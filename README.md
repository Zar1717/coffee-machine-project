# OOP Coffee Machine Project

This project is a simulation of a coffee machine using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The user can interact with the machine to order drinks, check the machine's resources, and make payments.

## Features:
- Select from 3 drink options: Latte, Espresso, and Cappuccino.
- Simulates real-world coffee machine functionality, checking for ingredient availability before making a drink.
- Processes payments by accepting coins and gives change when necessary.
- Generates a report of current resources and profit.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `main.py` file to start the coffee machine.
3. Follow the prompts to:
   - Order a drink
   - Check available resources (`report`)
   - Turn off the machine (`off`)

## Future Improvements:
- Add the ability to refill ingredients.
- Allow users to input custom drink recipes.
- Implement better error handling for invalid inputs.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
